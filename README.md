# CrimeProject
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.
All the project is available on : [Crime-Project](https://github.com/coco83algo/Crime-Project)

## Description
This project is using the API of [the police forces of the United Kingdom](https://data.police.uk/). In this API, you can find:
* all the 44 forces of the United Kingdom.
* Crimes commited in UK and which police force handled it.
* The description and some information of each police force.

To **use** this API:
* We added [Angular material](https://v10.material.angular.io/) to have some beatiful effects.
* We also added [charts](https://swimlane.gitbook.io/ngx-charts/) to a better view of crimes.
* We can't forget the [map](https://asymmetrik.com/ngx-leaflet-tutorial-angular-cli/) ! Which alowed us to show a beautiful map of the police forces in UK.
